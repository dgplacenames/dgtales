<h1>The <q>Snake-Bank</q></h1>
<p>
<span class=sc>Singular</span> things have occurred regarding reptiles. Even poisonous reptiles have been defeated of their mischief.
</p>
<p>
In the farm of <em>Bogue</em>, near the banks of the Ken, Kirkcudbrightshire, a singular circumstance took place regarding a <em>snake</em>. About fourscore years ago, a young shepherd, in Bogue farm, of the name of Græme, had paid his addresses to a young milkmaid. Mary R. did not reject him. It was supposed they were soon to be married.
</p>
<p>
It was the custom in <em>this</em> farm, at that time, and for forty years afterwards, to <em>milch</em> the ewes. Doubtless Allan Ramsay had seen <q>Peggy and Jenny,</q> or their fair prototypes, milking the ewes of Symon and Glaud. Doubtless, <q>Patie</q> often helped to <em>bught</em> the ewes to his fair mistress. Perhaps, even <q>Roger</q> did as much for his <em>surly</em> Jenny.
</p>
<p>
Many, however, besides shepherds and shepherdesses, on Glencorse Burn or the North-Esk, were employed in <em>bughting</em> and <em>milking</em> the ewes. In the pastoral part of Galloway the practice was frequent.
</p>
<p>
Well, young Græme had gone away to bring the ewes to the <em>bught</em>. He was somewhat longer than his <em>wont</em> in gathering them down. The sister of Græme and Mary R., the young milkers, were tired, and lay down. They lay down among <em>brakens</em>, at the foot of an old thorn, near to the bught. They both fell asleep. The young shepherd, as, at length, he drew near with his ewes, wondered that the <q>lasses</q> were not ready to receive him. The two girls had generally assisted him to <em>bught</em> the ewes. Leaving the flock in a little <em>hollow</em> near the milking-place, he stept <em>before</em> the ewes, to look for the lasses. He spied them both lying <em>asleep</em>. As he was just going to call them, he observed <em>something</em> creeping into the mouth of his favourite Mary! (It must be observed, she was lying on her back, with her mouth open, as sleepers in the fields sometimes do.) </p>
<p>
Presaging some evil, he thundered out, <q>That they must rise immediately.</q> They attempted to do so; but Mary felt herself very unwell, and scarce could assist at the <em>bughting</em>. Her lover, however, ordered her to run and <q>wear</q> 
</p>
<p>
As soon as the sheep were inclosed, Græme, somewhat roughly, ordered them to milk <em>immediately</em>. Mary almost staggered; and scarcely was able to begin. He pulled the <em>stoup</em>* from her, and sat down to milk. He ordered his sister to <em>milk</em> with all her might. The girls both wondered <em>what he meant</em>. When there was about a Scotch pint taken from the ewes, he sternly ordered Mary R. <q>to drink it.</q> She seemed to hesitate. But, what was unusual with him, he <em>cursed</em> her to drink it up, <q>else he would fell her!</q>
</p>
<p>
She complied. She drank it at the outside of the bught. Instantly she <em>sickened</em> much and vomited! She thought her stomach was <em>eased</em> of a weight: She could not tell what.
</p>
<p>
She vomited up a <em>snake!</em> Græme drew it instantly away. A moss was at hand, and he buried it there. Even his own sister saw not what it was. The poor Mary was <q>better,</q> and began to milk. For that evening there was little said about the circumstance.
</p>
<p>Not many months afterwards, Græme and his sweetheart were married. Sometimes she would ask him, <q>Why he was so <em>positive</em> for her to drink the ewe-milk?</q> He always evaded an explanation. Once, however, in a fretful mood, <q>Surely,</q> says she, <q>you can have little reason to hold <em>that</em> from me <em>now</em>. Perhaps you are <em>tired</em> of me, when you won't tell me that much?</q> • Milking-pail. 128 LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF

<p>
Thus teased, he complied. But there was cause for <em>both</em> to rue that compliance. The <em>thought</em> of having had a <em>serpent</em> within her preyed upon her mind. She could not divest herself of the <em>perilous</em> idea. She soon <em>fevered</em> and died! Poor Græme repented sore that ever he had confided the fatal secret!
</p>
<p>
And, even till the present hour, the <em>site</em> of <q>Græme's Bught</q> can be pointed out. And, even yet, there are <em>thorns</em> beside it. And, even till<em> this</em> moment, there is a <em>brae</em> which retains the name of <q>Snake-Bank.</q> Perhaps it may retain it for a century to come!
</p>
<p>
Nor let the tale be terribly disbelieved.—In summer 1823, a woman had been podding peas to a gentleman in Kent—Mr Baillie of Swanscombe. She had suckled her child, and laid it in a hedge. On returning from her work to offer it the <em>breast</em>, she found it dead. Her neighbours alleged she had murdered it! She denied; and the child was <em>opened</em> by a surgeon. A <em>snake</em> was found in its stomach! No aid was nigh to the infant!
