<h1>The Score</h1>
<p>
  A small oval shaped portion of land on the farm of Waterside. It is about 8 ft. by 4 marked by a small trench about 12 inches by 6. Tradition says that at one time while a farmer was on his way home from Dalry, he had halted about the church and disturbed the fairies (It is said in those times that the chapel had been a haunt of fairies) from which they pursued & overtook him at his place it appears he had a sword with him which he immediately drew it and scored this small portion of ground (& remained in till morning) in the name of the almighty, and the fairies immediately fled out of his sight, hence the name.
