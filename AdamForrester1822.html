<h1>Forester the Dauntless</h1>
<p>
<q>When, glimmering through the groaning trees, <br>
Kirk Alloway seemed in a bleeze; <br>
Through ilka bore the streams were glancing; <br>
And loud resounded mirth and dancing!</q> <br>
Burns
</p>
<p>
Adam Forester was a gentleman by birth and education, the head of a respectable family, and proprietor of Knocksheen, in the parish of Kells. His great grandfather was one of the few survivors who returned from the fatal battle of Flodden Field; and his father had opposed General Dalzell at Pentland Hills. Adam Forester was possessed of the hereditary bravery of his family, but like his contemporaries of that age, superstition held absolute dominion over his heart; he had also incurred the irreconcileable anger of the famed witches of St Johnstown, and in return avowed his hatred of them.
</p>
<p>
St Johnstown, formerly St John's Clauchan, was a burgh of barony at a very remote period; but forfeited its privileges as such for its adherence to the unfortunate House of Stuart, in 1715. It is situated at the head of the beautiful and romantic vale of Glenkens, and is renowned in tradition's ‘storied tale,’ for being honoured for many years by the residence of the apostle St John, from whom it derived its name. The stone chair upon which he usually sat, is still proudly shown to strangers as the most valuable relic of antiquity in the south of Scotland; and since the time of the holy apostle, it has held the person of several princes and nobles of ancient Caledonia. 'Tis even said that the valiant Sir Edward Bruce once sat upon it, after he had overcome the English in the victorious battle of Craigencailzie.
</p>
<p>
Adam Forester being detained late one evening in the village, mounted his milk-white steed, just as the <em>cuckoo clock</em> in the parlour of the alehouse he was leaving struck twelve; and he rode as fleetly down the Kirkgate, as ever did the famed steed of young Lochinvar, when he carried off the fair bride from the Hall of Netherby. 
</p>
<p>
The road at the time went close past the burying-ground of Dalry: it is indeed a wild and a lonely place; and well might the fearful passenger mistake the white blossomed hawthorn, for the ghost of some ancient warrior arisen from the dead, or the newly painted tomb-stone for a pale and a headless spectre.
</p>
<p>
As Adam approached, the church windows displayed one continued blaze of light, like the brilliant drawing-room of a proud noble, and loud bursts of mirth and revelry were echoed far and near, by rock, cavern, and glen. Soon was the bridle rein of thy lily-white courser, young Knocksheen! tied to a branch of the green elm tree that grows by the church-yard wall; and soon did thy keen enquiring eye read the mysteries that rang within.
</p>
<p>
O there was a sight for the young eye of a stripling!—a dance of naked, wrinkled witches!—amongst whom he recognised several old women of his acquaintance, who had been <em>bed-ridden</em> from his earliest remembrance, and objects of compassion and charity to the pious and benevolent. The heart of Adam Forester beat merrily in concert with the midnight revellers, and his foot involuntarily kept time to the musician's fiddle, who sat, like a proud prelate, in the pulpit, and every button of his short green cloak, seemed large and bright as his grandmother's <em>pewter trencher</em>. <q>I cam through in the riddle at the Carlin Heuch yestreen,</q> exclaimed Lucky H—r, who was footing a hornpipe with the sprightliness and agility of a girl of fifteen, and loud rang the chorus, 
</p>
<p><q>We learnt John Hope to dance, <br>
Jonn Hope to dance, John Hope to dance; <br>
We learnt John Hope to dance a country bumpkin brawly.</q>
</p>
<p>
Adam Forester could keep silence no longer: he knocked against the window frame with the handle of his whip, and cried out, <q>Ha, ha, Lucky H--r, ye’ll no deny that the morn!</q> All was instantly dark, and an infernal yell succeeded, to which the opening of a hundred blood hounds were nothing in comparison. Adam sprang over the wall of the church-yard, like the hawk from the hand of the falconer, and hardly had he remounted the terror struck ranger, when upwards of fifty black and infuriated witches darted upon him, like the mighty pike of Loch Arrow upon the trembling perch. 
</p>
<p>
Fast fled Adam Forester, but faster followed his pursuers: loud resounded the lash of his whip; but louder still arose the cry of Lucky H—r, and her enraged companions! The broad Holm of Craig Gubble witnessed that night as gallant a race as ever was recorded in the annals of the turf; whilst the clanking of his horse's feet, and the wild shrieks of his assailants, were heard for many a mile. Fast flew the mountain eagle to the fields below, for he weened it had been the noise of battle; and the wild raven hasted to feast on the blood of the slain. 
</p>
<p>
The stony brow of Waterside hill, was hardly gained, when down tumbled the breathless steed of young Knocksheen—but its dauntless rider instantly unsheathed his trusty glaive from its scabbard, and drew a circle round himself and horse in the name of Almighty God. 
</p>
<p>
<q>By the soul of my grandfather, the first who attempts to pass this ring, I will cleave her in pieces with my sword!</q> exclaimed Forester the Dauntless. A loud hiss was the only reply, for the hand of Heaven guarded the gallant youth, and hell could not prevail against him! There stood Adam Forester, guarded round and round by the demon spirits of old Dalry, till the red cock from a neighbouring farm, thrice crowed aloud, and ushered in the approach of another morning; and then they all instantly disappeared, like the love dream of a fair young damsel, and oh! wild and unearthly was their parting yell!
</p>
<p>
<q>I am right vexed thou hast lost thy tail,</q> said Forester the Dauntless, addressing his fallen steed; <q>and by the Cross!, thou also bearest the foul mark of an ugly hand upon thy back—as black as the soul of her who gave it!</q> continued he, wrathfully, <q>but get thee up, my peerless ranger, the stony brow of this hard mountain is not a meet resting place for thy wearied limbs.</q>
</p>
<p>
As he said this, the fleet footed animal sprang from the earth, and soon was his weļl-known neigh heard at the stable door of Knocksheen. 
</p>
<p>
The <em>witch score</em> drawn by young Knocksheen, is seen to the present day on Waterside hill, in the parish of Kells; and for many a year Captain Newall, of Waterside, and his brother Charles, cleaned it every Halloween morning with their own hands, and drank a cup of the best claret in their cellar, to the memory of <span class="sc">Forester the Dauntless</span>.
