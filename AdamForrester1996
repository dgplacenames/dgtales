<h1>Andrew Forrester</h1>
<p>
In dire straits an innocent person might use his imagination to protect himself. Andrew Forrester of Knocksheen realized he had been discovered when spying on a <span class=sc>coven</span> meeting at Waterside Hill, Galloway, around 1750. He drew his sword and, using it to scratch a rough line in the grass between himself and the witches who threatened him, uttered the words: <q q>I draw this score in the name of God Almighty and may nae evil ever pass over it.</q q> The witches were unable to cross the line and Forrester made good his escape (though not before one of the witches managed to snatch his horseâ€™s tail off).
