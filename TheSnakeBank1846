<h1>Snake Bank</h1>
<p>
A small eminence on the farm of Bogue the surface of which is chiefly Rough pasture. This name originates from the following circumstance. In former times it was a customary practice for farmers milking their ewes.  Two Girls whose <s>names</s> Surnames were Grame and Ramsey (Domestics in Bogue farm house) and a young Shepherd called Grame (brother to one of the females) was out Collecting the Ewes to the Bughts for the purpose of the young Women to Milk them, possibly the Shepherd had been longer than his wonted time of arriving with them.  As the two Girls had lay down on this Bank and fell fast asleep. As the Shepherd approached he observed something creeping into the Mouth of his favourite Mary Ramsey, which he instantly awoke them & immediately got about a scotch pint of milk drawn from the Ewes & sternly ordered Mary, to drink it. She drank it and immediately vomited up a Snake.  The Shepherd drew it instantly away & buried it in a Moss which was at hand, even R. & his own sister saw not it. Not many Months afterwards Grame & his Sweetheart got married & as soon as the secret was told her by her husband she immediately fevered & died.
