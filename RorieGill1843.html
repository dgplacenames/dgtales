<h1>Rorie Gill; or The Hunter's Moon. A Ballad.</h1>
<p>
  This Ballad, commemorative of the death of the celebrated <span class=”sc”>Rorie Gill</span>, who, from his many depredations, is with great propriety styled the Robin Hood of Galloway, was first suggested to me in the following accidental and rather interesting manner: 
</p>
<p>
  Having once occasion to travel from Newton-Stewart to Dalmellington, I resolved, instead of taking the circuitous road by Newgalloway, to pass over the mountains of Minnigaff, and through the savage scenery leading to Loch Doon, which for nearly thirty miles, is the most desolate and unfrequented track in Scotland. But before reaching the Mirrock side, I became enveloped in an exceedingly dense mist, which, as it prevented me from seeing to the distance of even a yard around, would certainly have compelled me to have lodged for the night with the wild birds of some neighbouring rock, had not the barking of a shepherd's dog at length enabled me to reach its master's cot on the farm of, —— where I was kindly received, and hospitably entertained until my departure on the following morning. The family in this place consisted of a very old man and woman, with their son, who was a widower, and several of his children. During the evening I was much amused by the old people relating wonderful stories of Ghosts and witches, every incident of which they religiously believed, although on other subjects, considering their remote situation, they were possessed of much general knowledge. They both were particularly fond of ancient poetry, and the old man recited the greater part of the <em>Cherrie and the Slae</em>, the scene of which is pointed out with great accuracy in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The old woman also sung several old songs; but that which most particularly arrested my attention, was the tradition of <em>the Hunter's Moon</em>, as she termed it, the particulars of which, she said, she had been familiar with from her infancy. She informed me also, that several old people of her acquaintance in the vale of Deuch, near to Carsephairn, possessed the very same story, and would confirm her statement should I incline to inquire concerning it. I before had often heard of <span class=”sc”>Rorie Gill</span>, as a once famous character in Galloway, but had not, until now, been made acquainted with any particulars of his legendary history. It was therefore with no small pleasure that I listened to my old informant's details, which that they might not in future escape me, I shortly afterwards embodied in the following stanzas:—

<div class="poem">
  <h2>Rorie Gill.</h2>
<div class="stanza">
  <span class="verse">—<q>little villains oft submit to fate,</q></span><br>
  <span class="verse">That great ones may enjoy the world in state.</q></span><br>
  <span class="verse"><span class="sc">Garth</span></span><br>
</div>
  
  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="verse1">Harvest is come; and the Hunter's Moon</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Is rising the highest hills aboon:</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Loud is the flap of the eagle's wing</span><br>
    <span class="verse">As she starts from her rock by the mountain spring,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">While echo carries o'er glen and brake</span><br>
    <span class="verse">The howl of the fox by Naberrie's lake.</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Sluggards are sleeping; but we must ride,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">For winter comes, and it cries—provide!</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Bugleman! sound the rallying call,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">For ready to mount are the troopers all,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Who, in defiance of danger, still</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Have followed the fortunes of <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.</span><br>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="verse1">On venison oft do I wish to dine</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And wash it down with the rosy wine.—</span><br>
    <span class="verse">My merry men, too, love wine,—and why?</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Should they not quaff it as well as I!</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Yet break we never the orphan's bread,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Nor bring down woe on the widow's head;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">We pass without harming the child of care,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Nor wish we industry's meed to share;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">We only take from the lordly Thane</span><br>
    <span class="verse">What honesty deems ill-gotten gain;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And even, his foeman's blood to spill</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Was ne'er the desire of <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.</span><br>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="verse1">By moonlight, amain, the shire of Ayr</span><br>
    <span class="verse">We sacked the fortlet of Fairly fair;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And whilst the bells of Kilwinning rung,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And the monks their latest vespers sung,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">We filched the gold of that holy shrine,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And drunk their health in their sacred wine;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And piously, too, ere we rode away,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">We forced the Abbot for us to pray;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Then, ere the breeze of the morning blew</span><br>
    <span class="verse">From roe, in her lair, the cold clear dew,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Behind us vanished Terenzean hill,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And safe in his mountains was <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.</span><br>.
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="verse1">Well was our trip to St. Mary's Isle</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Paid with the jewels of Dervorguil;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Yestreen, from Kenmure merrily, we</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Fast galloped to Castle Kennedy;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">The currach we launched, we sailed the pond,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">We pillaged the Castle, and stript the ground,—</span><br>
    <span class="verse">This night from Cruggleton we must bring</span><br>
    <span class="verse">The stud of the Gallovidian king.</span><br>
    <span class="verse">This golden spur once glanced on his heel;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">His was this baldric of burnished steel—,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And long ere morn, my merry men will</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Bring his best gelding to <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.</span><br>.
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="verse1">It was not the eagle, nor yet the fox,</span><br>
        <span class="verse">That raised the echo among the rocks:</span><br>
        <span class="verse">Oh! It was the searching bloodhound’s yell,</span><br>
        <span class="verse">And tramping of horsemen down the dell,</span><br>
        <span class="verse">And the shouts of many a forrester brave;—</span><br>
        <span class="verse">Ha! Now they reach the robber’s cave.</span><br>
        <span class="verse">And ere the guard, with his bugle’s sound,</span><br>
        <span class="verse">Can warn his merry men lurking round,</span><br>
        <span class="verse">Knockmains brave lord, who gallantly sped</span><br>
        <span class="verse">Baldoon’s huge adder—his country’s dread—</span><br>
        <span class="verse">Explores the robber’s cave at will,</span><br>
        <span class="verse">And springs unlooked for on <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.—</span><br>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="verse1">While now by the string of his bugle horn,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">The guard they hung on a lofty thorn,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">His pitying chieftain's wrath arose—</span><br>
    <span class="verse">He burst his bonds, and he sprung from his foes:</span><br>
    <span class="verse">But again they caught him; and thence away</span><br>
    <span class="verse">They bore him in haste to Kildorcan brae.</span><br>
    <span class="verse">No Justice Ayre was called, to ordain</span><br>
    <span class="verse">If his life should be spared, or straightway ta'en;—</span><br>
    <span class="verse">On earth, to make up his peace with Heaven,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">An hour he asked, but it was not given;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And long ere his men could rise on the hill,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Stiff hanged on a wuddy was on <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.</span><br>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <span class="verse1">Thus fell, in his prime, the bravest wight</span><br>
    <span class="verse">That ever gear hunting went by night.</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Lamented he was, though far and near</span><br>
    <span class="verse">The country long he had kept in fear,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And down at night, from the blasted tree</span><br>
    <span class="verse">By his merrymen carried away was he,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And where bridle-roads on the mountains meet,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">They laid him, without a winding-sheet,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">Save the heathery-turf that wrapt his breast,</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And left him, with tears, to his long long rest.</span><br>
    <span class="verse">There oft the wanderer stops to see</span><br>
    <span class="verse">The big cairn raised to his memory;</span><br>
    <span class="verse">And many bosoms with awe yet thrill</span><br>
    <span class="verse">To hear of the deeds of <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.</span><br>
