<h1>A Large Diamond on Criffel</h1>
<p>
  A curious piece of folklore is the legend relating to the existence of a large diamond on Criffel. It is many years since I heard this for the first time when staying at Southerness. The story is that seamen on board vessels coming up the Solway can on clear nights, see the gleaming of a large diamond, which is lying on Criffel, but although it can be seen a long distance off, when searched for it cannot be found, although the search may be most carefully made. As a matter of course, no consideration is given to the matter-of-fact reasoning which would point out that a diamond which could be visible so far off must be of dimensions which would make the Koh-i-noor and even larger gems pale into insignificance. If anything of the nature of a brilliant light is seen it is probably due to that of the moon glittering on some granite block or some small streamlet flowing over a boulder, a sight less likely to excite the cupidity of the observer, but immeasurably more full of delight to the lover of the beautiful than any diamond, however brilliant it may be.
