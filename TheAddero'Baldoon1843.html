<h1>A Verse from <em>Rorie Gill</em></h1>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class=“verse1”>It was not the eagle, nor yet the fox,</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>That raised the echo among the rocks:</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>Oh! It was the searching bloodhound’s yell,</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>And tramping of horsemen down the dell,</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>And the shouts of many a forrester brave;—</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>Ha! Now they reach the robber’s cave.</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>And ere the guard, with his bugle’s sound,</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>Can warn his merry men lurking round,</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>Knockmains brave lord, who gallantly sped</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>Baldoon’s huge adder—his country’s dread—</span><br>
<span class=“verse”>Explores the robber’s cave at will,</span><br>
  <span class=“verse”>And springs unlooked for on <span class="sc">Rorie Gill</span>.—</span><br>

<h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Walter Scott, in a letter to Joseph Train dated 7th March 1816, writes that <q>Rorie Gill is quite a stranger to me and I am glad to be made known to him in the modem dress in which you clothed him with considerable spirit.</q> Assuming that this refers to the poem quoted above, Train's mention of the Adder o' Baldoon predates the entry in Mactaggart's (1824) <Gallovidian Encyclopedia</em> by at least eight years.</li>
