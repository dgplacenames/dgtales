<h1>The Glenkens Tam o’ Shanter</h1>
<p>
<span class=sc>The</span> Tam O'Shanter of the Doon has rung through all Scotland. Pilgrimages were made to the Auld Brig o' Doon, some years previous to the erection of the splendid obelisk, which now graces the vestibule of Kirk Alloway. The <q>Winnock-bunker in the East,</q>—<q>Mungo's Well,</q>—and the <q>Chapman's Cairn,</q>—all are visited now,—monthly, quarterly, or annually;—and the antique cot, which proved the birth-place of Burns, and which stands at but a small distance from the Kirk Alloway, is almost forgotten amid the relics and reminiscences which mark the midnight adventure of the man who marred the midnight orgies of a band of witches. 
</p>
<p>
But it stands on strong tradition, that other kirks besides Kirk Alloway, and other rivers besides the Doon, have been the haunts of witches, and of witch-inspectors. For nigh the banks of the less famous Ken, may a circle still be seen, which, for a century or more, has commemorated a <q>dance o' witches,</q> and its perilous consequences of their orgies having been inspected.
</p>

Beneath a little ridge of rocks, in a little verdant spot, on the east side of the hill of Waterside, a farm in Galloway, very lately could have been marked—or may still be marked—an oval circle. This circle, says a local tradition, was drawn around himself and his horse by a man who was hotly pursued by a host of witches. Finding that neither he nor his horse could get a foot farther, the determined fugitive alighted, and unsheathing a sword, on whose blade was engraven the sacred name of Jehovah, he twice waved it around him, and then describing a circle with its point on the sward, he charged, in the name of God, his pursuers <em>not</em> to overstep that circle. The mysterious band—furious as they were—stood, as mysteriously arrested. They had no power to overpass the circle;—but surrounding it, menaced the horseman until a neighbouring cock crew, when one of the most inveterate of the gang drew a large knife from beneath her apron, cut the horse's tail, which, it seems, hung beyond the verge of the sacred circle. They then scampered off; and the horseman, standing firm in the ring with the drawn sword still in his hand, awaited the day-break, and then, renewing the circle, and giving thanks to his Maker, he rode home to his residence.
</p>
<p>
Now for the development.—Foster of Knocksheen, a respectable proprietor of his own farm, had been at the village of Dalry on business in the evening of the day;—and being detained until near midnight, he mounted his horse to go home. It behoved him to travel past the Kirk of Dalry, which overhangs a winding of the Ken, nigh to a ford, which was used then, and is used to this day. On passing the kirk gate, Foster was surprised at seeing lamp-light in the kirk; and curiosity impelled him to ride his startled horse to one of the eastern windows, from where he peeped into the sacred edifice. Here, indeed, he saw an <q>unco sicht,</q> witches, or at least women, in a dance on the area. Standing quietly, for a little, however, he at length discovered the very landlady of the inn where he had spent some part of the evening. Unable to restrain himself longer, Foster bawls out, <q>Aye—are ye there, Lucky ——?</q> In a moment, then, the lights were extinguished; and the horseman, hearing the words, <q>Catch him,</q> vociferated, made his horse spring the kirk-yard dyke, and galloped towards the ford of the Ken. The pursuers waded or swam after him, and chased him up the Waterside hill, which was his nearest route to Knocksheen. Gaining upon him, however, Foster was obliged to halt, and to draw the mysterious circle which we have already described.
</p>
<p>In 1830, the vestige of this circle might be still observable. Certain it is, that Foster, as long as he lived, and his sons and grandsons after him, made a point of renewing the circle annually. The lineal descendants of Foster are yet respectable in the village of Dalry; and the story is not obliterated on the banks of the Ken.
</p>
<p>
We pass no opinion whether or not there have been really a Weird Sisterhood, for 140 years bygone, either on the banks of the Ken or Doon. Our grandsires believed that such uncanny beings existed; and that they sometimes took dances in kirks. Walter Scott's Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft are meant to destroy an opinion in which none, at one time, seemed to have believed more firmly or factitiously than he himself. Sure we are, however, that the circle described must have been drawn by somebody; and why was Foster wont so frequently and faithfully to visit and renew it? Wodrow records, that during the Persecution, the sacrilegious Grierson of Lag publicly stabled his troopers' horses in the kirk of Dalry. One would almost as pleasantly listen to the mirth of midnight women in a Presbyterian church, as be startled by the unweirdly neighings and pawings of a persecutor's cavalry. We are sure that Lag and his dragoons were no poetical or romantic beings, whatever substantial connection they might have with the Prince of Darkness.
