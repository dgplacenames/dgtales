  <h1>Jock Mulldroch</h1>
  <p>
    A fellow who lived at <em>Craigwaggie</em>, Galloway, once, perhaps about 150 years ago. Tradition says that he <em>laid eggs</em>, ay eggs, larger than <em>goose eggs</em>, and strangely spreckled black and yellow; he used to <em>cackle</em> too after he laid them, which was on a <em>truff laft amang a wheen breckans</em>; sometimes he was called <em>Craigwaggie's meikle chuckie</em>; once a fortnight he is said to have produced an egg, and his mother, after having sold a few of them as <em>bonny goose eggs</em>, she set a couple of them beneath a <em>braw tappend hen to clock</em>. Long and <em>dreich</em> did the favourite <em>chucky</em> of <em>Lucky Mulldroch</em> sit on them before they were hatched; at length they <em>chipped</em>, and out came two little <em>lads</em> clad in green, and under the <em>gudewife's</em> care they <em>thrave</em>, and were well known long over the south of Scot land by the title of the <em>Birlies</em>. <em>Willie</em> and <em>Wattie Birly</em> were well liked by every body; they were something in the nature of <em>brownies</em>, or rather <em>mangrell fairies</em>. They va nished away though, and after the year <em>forty</em>, the year of the <em>lang storm</em>, they never were heard of; some think they sank in a <em>snaw wride</em>, and afterwards into a <em>Qua</em>.
