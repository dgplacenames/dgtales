<h1>Adam Forester</h1> 
<p>
The old church of Dalry, like the famous Alloway Kirk, seems, according to a rather mythical tradition, to have been the scene of diabolical orgies. The tradition, as given by two local writers, is to the following effect:â€”Adam Forester, proprietor of Knocksheen, had been detained one evening until near midnight in the public-house at Dalry. On the way home he had to pass the church, and being, perhaps, like the famous <q>Tam O'Shanter,</q> through indulging in <q>inspiring bold John Barleycorn,</q> ready to defy all dangers in the shape of goblin and spirit, he very soon had his mettle tested. On reaching the church the windows <q>seemed in a bleeze,</q> and from within loud bursts of mirth and revelry reached the ears of the astonished laird. Nothing daunted, however, he dismounted, and securing his horse to a tree near the churchyard wall, he peered in at the window, and to his astonishment amongst those engaged in the <q>dance o' witches,</q> were several old women of his acquaintance, amongst whom was the landlady of the public-house where he had spent the greater part of the evening, and which he had just left. Horrified with such desecration of the sacred edifice, and unable longer to restrain his displeasure, Forester shouts <q>Ha! ha! Lucky, ye'll no deny this the morn!</q> knocking at the same instant against the window frame with his whip.

In a moment the lights were extinguished, and the witches with loud yells rushed out of the church after him; but the laird having gained his horse went off at a furious gallop for the ford on the Ken, his pursuers following hard upon him, and their frantic and hideous shouts striking terror to his heart. As they could not cross the running stream they flew to the Brig o' Ken, six miles distant, where they crossed, and overtook Adam on Waterside hill, tearing all the hair out of the horse's tail; and <q>Lucky,</q> getting her <q>black hand</q> on the horse's hip, she left its impression there for life. The laird, finding that he could proceed no farther, dismounted, and was only saved from being torn to pieces by describing a circle in God's name round himself and horse. This charm proved effectual. The fury of the mysterious band was arrested, and at daybreak he rode home to his residence. The story is still current in the Glenkens, and what is supposed to be the circle drawn by the laird is pointed out on Waterside hill.

An old lady, who died about forty years ago, aged eighty-five, heard her mother say that she had seen Adam Forester riding on his white horse with the impression of Lucky's <q>black hand</q> on its left hip.

Wodrow records that during the persecution Grierson of Lag stabled his troopers' horses in the church of Dalry, and it was in this village that the great rising of the Covenanters originated, which terminated in the battle of Rullion Green.
