<h1>Adam Forrester in <em>Galloway Gossip</em></h1>
<h2>Burns</h2>
<p>
<span class=”sc”>By</span> a’ accounts o’ him, he wus a queer kin’ o’ man that Burns, onywey.
</p>
<p>
He wusna an ill-hertit man, an wus sweer tae get onybyddt fine’t, especially if it wus a widda woman. They said he ey contrive’t tae let them hae a frienly hint, in time tae let them tak care o’ theirsels.
</p>
<p>
He dina tak ower gude care o’ hissel, A’m thinkin, an maybe wus his ain warst frien: never fu a’thegither but joost as seldom sober.  Ye see he gat in wi the gentry, an they made o’ him, an faltter’t his vanity, an he likit it, an he try’t tae do the wey they did, tae try an pass for a gentry too, an that wus the ruin o’ him.
</p>
<p>
The doctor’s mither an Burns’s wife wus verra intimate, an the doctor’s faither an Mr Burns wus weel aquantit too. It wus him yt tell’t Burns the story he made Tam o’ Shanter oot o’t, an he made a verra gude han o’t.
</p>
<h2>Forrester’s Circle</h2>
<p>
<span class=”sc”>Yin</span> o’ my sons publish’t the original story, but A may joost gie a kin o’ sketch o’t here.
</p>
<p>
It wus a man they ca’t Adam Forrester, an he wus the laird o’ Knocksheen in the Kells, an he had been drinkin at Lucky Hare’s at Unnerhill, in the Clachan o’ Da’ry, but he wus far frae fu whun he left.
</p>
<p>
He had a kin o’ notion o’ Lucky Hare, an use’t tae plague her aboot sellin hersel tae the deil tae gar her look young an bonnie.
</p>
<p>
His wey hame wus doon the aul’ road atween the kirkyaird an the moat, across the Ken at the ford, bye Craiggubble Inn, an up alang the bridle road ower Waterside hill, an hame that wey.
</p>
<p>
Whun he wus gaun doon bye the moat he heard the soon’ o’ a fiddle in the aul’ kirk, an he wunner’t whut a fiddle could be doin there; an as he rade alang in sicht o’t, he saw a licht in the wundas. It wus a fine clear starlicht nicht, but nae mune, sae it couldna be the munelicht streamin through the wundas; an his curiosity gar’t him ride on tae see whut it wuss, for there wus nae dyke than.
</p>
<p>
He could har’ly get the beast up tae tae the wunda, but whun he did, an lookit in, he saw aul’ Davie M’Clemmet, yt had been bedridden for twunty year, stannin in the pulpit fiddlin awa like mad, an a hail lot o’ men an women dancin in the body o’ the kirk, as yaul as if nane o’ them wus twunty.
</p>
<p>
Ye see they hadna pews in the aul’ kirk than.
</p>
<p>
He sat an lookit at them a gude while, an he ken’t maist every yin o’ them; a gey wheen o’ them aul’ dune buddies, cripple’t or bedridden, an a wheen mae o’ them decent respectable men an women, some o’ them elders o’ the kirk, yt naebuddy wud ever ‘a’ suspectit.
</p>
<p>
It was maistly reels they dance’t, an there wus yin yauler nor the lave, yt the deil maistly had for a pairtner—for he wus yin o’ the dancers—but Forrester couldna get a sicht o’ her face for a lang time. At last there wus a threesome reel, an <q>Aul’ Sandy</q> wus yin o’ the set, an the yaul lass wus anither; an hoo she dance’t! he had never seen ocht like it; but his een fairly set in his heid whun he gat a glisk o’ her face, an fun oot it wus nae ither nor Lucky Hare herself, yt he had been tell’t wus oot at a howdyin.
</p>
<p>
Whun the reel wus ower he put his mooth tae a brokken pen o’ the wunda, an cry’t in—<q>Weel dance’t, Lucky Hare! ye’ll no deny this the morn.</q>
</p>
<p>
Wi that the yells begood, an the cursin an sweerin wus awsome, an Forrester thocht it wus time tae be oot o’ that, an set spurs tae his beast, an doon the brae an through the ford; an by the time he gat tae Craiggubble the haill crew o’ them wus at his heels, scraichin as if they had been a’ deevils thegither.
</p>
<p>
He up the hill as hard as he could gallop, but by the time he gat tae the tap the beast wus dune, an the wutches makin fast up on him; sae he lap aff in the middle o’ a wee bit meadow, an takin the beast by the bridle, pu’t oot his sword, an drew a score on the grun wi’t in the name o’ Gude, sayin—<q>A draw this score in the name o’ Gude Almichty, an may nae evil thing ever pass ower’t. </q>
</p>
<p>
By this time they wur close at him, an flew at him like as mony teegers, but whun they cam tae the score they startit suddenly back, an couldna wun ower’t, but stood cursin an threatnin him, an tryin tae fley the beast, tae gar’t push Forrester ower the score, till they wud get haud o’ him.
</p>
<p>
Yae time it startit a bit, an yae side o’ the hip gaed ower, an the deevil claucht at the tail wi the yae han, an gat a haud o’ the naur hip wi the ither, an try’t tae draw’t ower, but Forrester contrive’t tae draw’t in again; only the deil wudna let gae the tail, an it pairtit on the edge o’ the score, an Aul’ Sandy gat it an keepit it.
</p>
<p>
Efter a while the cock o’ The Cairnford craw’t, an the minute the wutches heard it their pooer depairtit, an they disappear’t, an Forrester bade till daylicht, an gaed aff hame.
</p>
<p>
The gress a’ roon him, tae the verra edge o’ the score, wus scowder’t tae the mools, an for three or fowr yairds ootside; but that inside wusna touch’t, an afore leavin he gaed doon an thankit the Lord for his miraculous escape.
</p>
<h2>Commemoration</h2>
<p>
<span class=”sc”>Next</span>day he cam wi a spade, an hokit a dutch a’ roon by whaur it wusna brunt, an every year he cam on the same day an clean’t it oot, an whun he dee’t his son did it.
</p>
<p>
Whun the doctor wus a boy, Captain Newall, the laird o’ Waterside, use’t tae clean’t oot wi his ain hans, an than his brither Charlie did it, an they ey took a lot o’ claret up tae the score, an everybuddy yt cam had tae drink tae the memory o’ Adam Forrester, an confusion tae the wutches, the warlocks, an the devil.
</p>
<p>
Adam Wallace, the plaisterer in the clachan, yt’s mairry’t on the last o’ the Forresters, cleans’t oot noo, an haes dune’t for mony a year.*
</p>
<p>
If ye tak a beast o’ aboot sixteen hans an set it in the score, an tak it by the bridle wi yae han, an a stick aboot three fit an a half lang in the ither, an draw a score frae the heels o‘ the horse on the yae side, roon tae its heels on the ither, an if ye’r aboot five fit ten in heicht, the score ‘ll be joost the same as the inner edge o’ the dutch.
</p>
<p>
Adam Forrester’s granfaither wus yin o’ the fechtin Covenanters, an focht again General Da’yell at the Pentlans, an his great-great-granfaither wus a captain in the Scoth airmy at Flodden, an yin o’ the verra few Gallawa men yt cam back again.
</p>
<p>
Whun the doctor’s mither wus a wee lass at the skule, she saw Knocksheen’s mere mony a time, an yince had a ride on’t, joost for the name o’ the thing. Lots o’ weans had rides on’t, joost tae be able tae say sae whun they wur grown up.
</p>
<p>
It wus a laich-set grey mare an wantit the tail, an on the naur hip there wus the sted o’ a han, no unlike a man’s but far bigger, an it wus joost like the brand o’ a het airn on a bullock, an there wus a deeper pairt nor the rest at the ens o’ the fingers, as if the nails had been sunk deep intae’t. She dee’t in 1840 at the age o’ 84, sae that wud gie 1765 as the time she got the ride.
</p>
<p>
It wus ey the Halloween day the clean’t the score, sae that likely wud be aboot the time o’ the adventure; but ye’ll fin the haill history o’t in <q>Lowran Castle. <q>
</p>
<p>
*Adam Wallace is deid noo too, an Glendarroch haes clean’t it oot sin than; but noo he’s deid too, an Garroch’s cleanin’t oot.—1901
